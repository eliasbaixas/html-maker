# html-maker

 Minimalistic HTML builder based on
[space-pen](https://github.com/atom-archive/space-pen).

## Installation

```bash
npm install html-maker --save
```

## Example:

Here's a CoffeeScript example. The html is generated by a function
that is evaluated in the scope of an HtmlMaker instance, so
it has access to methods for each HTML element through `this`:

```coffee
HtmlMaker = require 'html-maker'
view = ->
  @h1 'Greetings'
  @div class: 'x', =>
    @span class: 'first', 'hi'
    @span class: 'second', 'there!'
  @p 'paragraph'
  @p =>
    @text 'yet'
    @b 'another'
    @text 'paragrah'
html = HtmlMaker.render view
```

The generated HTML text will be as follows (albeit without the indentation):

```html
<h1>Greetings</h1>
<div class="x">
  <span class="first">hi</span>
  <span class="second">there!</span>
</div>
<p>paragraph</p>
<p>yet<b>another</b>paragrah</p>
```

Instead of evaluating the html-building closure in the
scope of an HtmlMaker (i.e. having the builder in `this`),
the builder can be passed as an argument to the closure:

```coffee
HtmlMaker = require 'html-maker'
view = (html) ->
  html.h1 'Greetings'
  html.div class: 'x', =>
    html.span class: 'first', 'hi'
    html.span class: 'second', 'there!'
  html.p 'paragraph'
  html.p =>
    html.text 'yet'
    html.b 'another'
    html.text 'paragrah'
html = HtmlMaker.render view
```
